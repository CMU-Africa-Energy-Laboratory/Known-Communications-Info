# Known-Communications-Info
Information, referenced to photographs, about the physical and other layers of the communications arrangement between outside devices and the battery conditioner box, and between the battery conditioner box and the module boards.

As A123 is no longer in operation, and the equipment was designed in 2008, documentation is difficult to find. The strongest form of documentation is one level up in the architecture, viewing the ESS as a device to be troubleshot, in the file "BAE HDS System ...pdf" (this repository). It has diagnostic procedures for diagnosing  communications problems. Note in particular page 196, pg 208.

Insights may be gleaned from comments on related BMS made by the same manufacturer and general communications practice.
